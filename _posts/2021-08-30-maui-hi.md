Some friends and I went to Maui in April - some of the most fun I've had. We rented motorcycles, saw dolphins and turtles, snorkled, and drank on the beach. I rented a Jeep Wrangler and had some fun flying the DJI Air 2 and captured a few really good shots. Be sure to see the full album for this one.
